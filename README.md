**AI-Powered Research Paper Generator with Visual Diagrams & PDF Export**

ScholarSanim AI is an intelligent research-paper generation tool built using **Google AI Studio**.
It allows users to create structured, academic-style research papers from a single prompt.
The system automatically generates:

* 📄 **Full research paper text**
* 🧠 **Structured sections (Abstract, Intro, Methods, Results, Conclusion)**
* 🟦 **Vector-style conceptual diagrams**
* 🖼️ **Visual explanations when relevant**
* 📥 **Downloadable PDF output**

This project demonstrates modern AI application design using prompt-engineering, modular output formatting, and automated document generation.
